:term:`EAGLE` currently includes a prototype EAGLE model trained with
global :term:`GFS` data.

EAGLE configurations were provided by Tim Smith at NOAA Physical
Sciences Laboratory.

Training Data
------------------

The EAGLE training dataset combines regridded global and regional
forecast data.

At a glance:

* :term:`GFS` is conservatively regridded to 1 degree.
* The training period spans ``2015-02-01T06`` through ``2023-01-31T18``.
* The validation period spans ``2023-02-01T06`` through ``2024-01-31T18``.
* The testing period spans ``2024-02-01T06`` through ``2025-01-31T18``.

``250``, ``300``, ``400``, ``500``, ``600``, ``700``, ``850``, ``925``, and
``1000``.


Model Architecture
------------------

The EAGLE model uses the following architecture:

* Encoder and Decoder: Graph Transformer
* Processor: Sliding Window Transformer
* Latent space is a 4x coarsened data space

The graph configuration connects targets to nodes through nearest neighbors in
the encoder and decoder, with ``encoder_knn=12`` and ``decoder_knn=3``.

The latent mesh is four times coarser than the native data resolution.
