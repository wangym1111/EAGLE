Quickstart Guide
====================

This section provides a recipe for an end-to-end run of nested- and global-EAGLE on :term:`Ursa`. To run a global configuration with this quickstart guide, replace references to ``nested`` with ``global``. At present, Ursa is the only supported 
platform. Future development will include additional platforms.

.. note::

   GNU ``make`` version 3.82 or higher is required.

**Complete the following steps from the** ``src/`` **directory.**

.. note:: The EAGLE runtime software environment currently requires over 50 GB of disk space. Consider available space, quota, etc. when choosing where to clone the EAGLE repository and run the following steps.

.. _QuickstartWorkflow:

Building and Running :term:`EAGLE`
=========================================

#. Create all environments

   .. code-block:: bash

      make env cudascript=ursa

   This step creates the runtime software environment, comprising conda virtual environments to support data preparation, 
   training, :term:`inference`, and verification. The ``conda/`` subdirectory it creates is self-contained and can be removed 
   and recreated by running the ``make env`` command again, as long as pipeline steps are not currently running.

   Developers who will be modifying Python driver code should replace ``make env`` with ``make devenv``, which will 
   create the same environments but also install additional code-quality tools for formatting, linting, shellchecking, 
   typechecking, unit testing, and :term:`YAML` linting.

.. note::

   EAGLE virtual environments are built using both conda and pip packages. If you examine the output from the ``make env`` command above, you may see messages like the following, from pip:

   .. code-block:: text

      ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.

   This will be followed by a report of packages pip believes are not installed or are installed with incompatible versions. These messages are due to fundamental differences in how conda and pip operate, and are generally safe to ignore. But please open an :ref:`Issue <Issues>` if you later encounter problems you believe are related to package versions.

#. Create the EAGLE YAML config

   .. code-block:: bash

      make config compose=base:nested:ursa >eagle.yaml

   The ``config`` target operates on ``.yaml`` files in the ``config/`` directory, so this command composes ``config/base.yaml``, ``config/nested.yaml``, 
   and ``config/ursa.yaml`` and redirects the composed config into ``eagle.yaml``.

#. Set the ``app.base`` value in ``eagle.yaml`` to the absolute path to the current ``src/`` directory.

   The run directories from subsequent steps, along with the output of those steps, will be created in the ``run/<expname>`` 
   subdirectory of ``app.base``, where ``<expname>`` is the value of ``app.experiment_name``.

   Verify the ``app.account`` value. The default configuration sets ``app.account`` to ``epic``. If you do not have access to the ``epic`` account on Ursa, update this value to an account you are authorized to use.

#. Create training data

   .. code-block:: bash

      make data config=eagle.yaml

   This step provisions data required for training and inference. The ``data`` target delegates to targets 
   ``grids-and-meshes``, ``zarr-gfs``, and ``zarr-hrrr``, which can also be run individually (e.g. ``make grids-and-meshes config=eagle.yaml``), but note that ``grids-and-meshes``, which runs locally, must be run first. The ``zarr-gfs`` and ``zarr-hrrr`` targets can be run in quick succession, as they submit batch jobs: Do not proceed until their batch jobs complete successfully (see the files ``run/<expname>/data/*.out``).

#. Train the ML model

   .. code-block:: bash

      make training config=eagle.yaml

   This step trains a model using data provisioned by the previous step. It submits a batch job; do not proceed until 
   the batch job completes successfully (see the file ``run/<expname>/training/runscript.training.out``).

#. Run inference

   .. code-block:: bash

      make inference config=eagle.yaml

   This step performs inference, producing a forecast. It submits a batch job. Do not proceed until the batch job 
   completes successfully (see the file ``run/<expname>/inference/runscript.inference.out``.)

#. Model verification

   .. _QuickstartVerification:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      make vx-grid-global config=eagle.yaml
      make vx-grid-lam config=eagle.yaml
      make vx-obs-global config=eagle.yaml
      make vx-obs-lam config=eagle.yaml

   For running just the global verification run, only submit ``vx-grid-global`` and ``vx-obs-global``.

   Before running verification, the :term:`WXVX` driver will run ``prewxvx`` to prepare forecast output from the previous step. See the files ``run/<expname>/vx/prewxvx/{global,lam}/runscript.prewxvx-*.out`` for details.
   
   These steps perform verification of the ``global`` or :term:`LAM` forecasts against gridded analyses (``*-grid-*``) or 
   PrepBUFR observations (``*-obs-*``) as truth. Each submits a batch job, so the four ``make`` commands can be run in quick 
   succession to get all the batch jobs running in parallel. When each batch job completes, MET ``.stat`` files and ``.png`` 
   plot files can be found under the ``stats/`` and ``plots/`` subdirectories of ``run/<expname>/vx/grid2{grid,obs}/{global,lam}/run/``. 
   The files ``run/<expname>/vx/*.log`` contain the logs from each verification run.

#. Make additional :term:`visualization` outputs

   .. code-block:: bash

      make vis-grid-global config=eagle.yaml
      make vis-grid-lam config=eagle.yaml
      make vis-obs-global config=eagle.yaml
      make vis-obs-lam config=eagle.yaml

   For running just the global visualization run, only submit ``vis-grid-global`` and ``vis-obs-global``.

   These steps will first call ``eagle-tools``'s ``postwxvx`` tool to create and save a series of netCDF files with all relevant statistics in the corresponding ``wxvx`` directory for each variable. It will then create a series of basic plots (provided by `DataArray.plot() <https://docs.xarray.dev/en/latest/generated/xarray.DataArray.plot.html#xarray.DataArray.plot>`_ from the ``xarray`` library) in the ``run/<expname>/visualization/grid2{grid,obs}/{global,lam}/plots-basic`` directory.

   For the grid-based ``vis-grid-global`` and ``vis-grid-lam`` targets, additional error plots (forecast vs truth differences) will be created under ``run/<expname>/visualization/grid2grid/{global,lam}/plots-spatial-stats/``. These plots depend on 1. The config value at key-path ``vx.grid2grid.{global,lam}.wxvx.wxvx.ncdiffs`` being set to ``true``, which instructs MET to produce netCDF difference files during verification; and 2. The config block at key-path ``visualization.grid2grid.{global,lam}.visualization.spatial_stat_plots``, which enables and configures plot generation, being present.

#. Run inference in near-real-time (NRT)

   a. Create the EAGLE NRT config 
   
   .. code-block:: bash

      make config compose=base:nested:ursa:nrt-nested > nrt-composed.yaml

   b. Set the ``app.base`` value in ``nrt-composed.yaml`` to the absolute path to the current ``src/`` directory.

   This should match the path used when generating the main EAGLE config above.
   
   Two additional paths may require attention:
      - inference.anemoi.checkpoint_dir
      - grids_and_meshes.rundir

   If you are following only the quickstart workflow, you do not need to modify these values. The config automatically pulls both paths from 
   the quickstart run. However, if you ran multiple experiments or stored outputs in a different location, update these paths so they point 
   to the correct directories.

   c. Realize the EAGLE NRT config

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      make realize config=nrt-composed.yaml > nrt.yaml

   This creates the final config to begin a NRT run. It is required because it freezes the ``NOW`` environment 
   variable across the entire configuration. Since jobs may be submitted at different times, this ensures a 
   consistent timestamp is used throughout the run.
   
   d. Load current initial conditions
   
   .. code-block:: bash
      
      make data config=nrt.yaml

   e. Run inference

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      make inference config=nrt.yaml

   Your forecast will save to ``path/to/eagle/src/run/default/nrt_inference/YYYY/MM/DD/HH/inference``.
