Drivers
==============================================================================

The various software components required by EAGLE are executed by :term:`uwtools` drivers implemented as Python 
modules under ``eagle/``. By default, the targets in ``Makefile`` invoke drivers' most comprehensive 
tasks, i.e. those that configure and execute the component to produce its final output. However, each driver 
provides a number of tasks, some of which depend on others, and lower-level tasks can be invoked to request less 
than full execution of the driver, which can be useful during development and debugging.

To request a specific task, add a ``task=`` clause to the appropriate ``make`` target. To see a list of available 
tasks, specify ``task=?``.

.. _InspectAvailableTasks:

Inspect Available Tasks
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To list the tasks available for the ``Inference`` driver:

.. code-block:: text

    $ make inference config=eagle.yaml task=?
    + uw execute --module eagle/inference/inference.py --classname Inference
    [2026-02-27T23:58:43]    ERROR Available tasks:

    [2026-02-27T23:58:43]    ERROR     Run directory provisioned with all required content.
    [2026-02-27T23:58:43]    ERROR   run

    [2026-02-27T23:58:43]    ERROR     Validate the UW driver config.

The ``provisioned_rundir`` task provisions the run directory with all its required content, but 
would not execute the ``anemoi-inference`` component. The ``run`` task would fully execute inference.

.. _ProvisionRunscript:

Provision a Runscript
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To invoke the ``Inference`` driver's ``runscript`` task, provisioning only the component's runscript:

.. code-block:: text

    $ make inference config=eagle.yaml task=runscript
    + uw execute --config-file eagle.yaml --module eagle/inference/inference.py --classname Inference --task runscript --batch
    [2026-02-27T22:35:11]     INFO Schema validation succeeded for inference config
    [2026-02-27T22:35:11]     INFO Validating config against internal schema: platform
    [2026-02-27T22:35:11]     INFO Schema validation succeeded for platform config
    [2026-02-27T22:35:11]     INFO inference runscript.inference: Executing
    [2026-02-27T22:35:11]     INFO inference runscript.inference: Ready

The previously non-existent ``run/<expname>/inference/`` directory now contains:

.. code-block:: text

    $ tree run/<expname>/inference/
    run/<expname>/inference/
    \--- runscript.inference

    1 directory, 1 file

.. _EditingProvisionedRunscript:

Editing a Provisioned Runscript
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since ``uwtools`` driver tasks are idempotent, now that ``runscript.inference`` exists, it will not be overwritten 
by subsequent driver invocations. It could now be manually edited, for example to add debugging statements, and 
the ``run`` task then invoked to execute inference with the debugging statements in place. If ``runscript.inference`` 
were manually deleted and the driver invoked again, the runscript would be recreated with its default contents.
